# Python Data Analysis with Matplotlib visualization

Originally created in Jupyter notebook, this app analyzes data from Google Play and Apple IOS app stores.
First we eliminate apps with corrupted/misplaced data values/ratings, then we remove duplicates. Once we have
unique apps we go through and make sure we are only holding onto english applications and then one more round of data
cleaning to get free, english apps.

From there we can determine the highest rated apps in the app store, or most downloaded apps in the play store. This allows us to
determine what types of free, eglish apps are highly rated/downloaded.
